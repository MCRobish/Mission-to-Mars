# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this repository was to learn webscraping of different websites in order to combine into a mongo database, as well as a website using flask. The webpage created is shown below. 

The finished files are in the "Challenge" file, which includes the app.py file to run the flask app. It also includes the scraping.py file, which includes the functions to pull for each of the sites. This is run through the "Scrape New Data" button on the website. Lastly, there is an index.html formatting file to set up the site formatting using bootstrap.
